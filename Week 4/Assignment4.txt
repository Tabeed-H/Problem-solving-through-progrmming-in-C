3. Compute the printed value of i of the C program given below;
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int i = 2;
            i =  i++;
            printf("%d", i);
            return 0;
        }
    a) 2
    b) 3
    c) 4
    d) Compiler error

    Answers:
    a) 2

    Explanation:
    Understanting the main difference between a pre-process and post-process operator
    i++ is a post-process operator which implies first i will be assigned the value of i and then the increment will take place.
        i = i++
    In case of a pre-proces operator eg. ++i, first the value of i will be incremented and then assigned to the variable.
            EXANPLE:
                int i = 1;
                i = i++  returns 1
                i = ++1 returns 2

4. If multiple conditions are used in a single if statement then the testing of those conditions are done
    a) From Right to Left
    b) From Left to right
    c) Randomly
    d) None

    Answers:
    b)From lef to right

5. What is the purpose of the given program? n is the input number given by the user.
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int n, x = 0, y;
            printf("Enter an interger: ");
            while(n != 0)
            {
                y = n % 10;
                x = x -y;
                n = n / 10;
            }
            printf("Output is = %d", x);
            return 0;
        }
    a) Sum of the digits of a number
    b) Negative sum of the digits of a number
    c) Reverse of a number
    d) The same number is printed

    Answers:
    b) Negative sum of the digits of a number

6. while(1) is used in a program to create
    a) False statement
    b) Infinite loop
    c) Terminating the loop
    d) Never executed loop

    Answers:
    b) Infinite loop

7. What will be the value of a ,b, c after the execution of the followings
        int a = 5, b = 7, c = 111;
        c /= ++a * b--;
    a) a=5, b=6, c=2;
    b) a=6, b=7, c=1;
    c) a=6, b=6, c=2;
    d) a=5, b=7, c=1;
    
    Answers:
    c) a=6, b=6, c=2;

    Explanation:
    SOLVING
    111 /= ++5 * 7-- (to understand this step knowledge of pre-process and post-process operator is required)
    111 /= 6 * 7
    111 /= 42
    2 

    a = 6, b = 6, c = 2

8. What will be printed when the following C code is executed?
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            if('A' < 'a')
            {
                printf("NPTEL");
            }else
            {
                printf("PROGRAMMING");
            }
            return 0;
        }
    a) NPTEL
    b) PROGRAMMING
    c) No output
    d) Compilation error as A and a are not declared as character variable

    Answers:
    a) NPTEL

    Explanation:
    ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and ASCII value of 'a' is 97
    65 < 97 is true

    b) char
    c) long
    d) All of the above

    Answers:
    d) All of the above

10. What will be the output of the following program?
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int x = 1;
            switch(x)
            {
                case 1: printf("Choice is 1 \n");
                default: printf("Choice other than 1 \n");
            }
            return 0;
        }
    a) Choice is 1
    b) Choice other than 1
    c) Both (a) and (b)
    d) Syntax error 

    Answers:
    c) Both (a) and (b)   

    Explanation:
    There is no break statement in case 1 which is the correct answer therefore the default statement is also executed.
