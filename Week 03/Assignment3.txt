2. What is the output of the following program? (% indicated mod operation)

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            float i = -3.0;
            int k = i % 2;
            printf("%d", k);

        }
    a) -1
    b) 1
    c) 0
    d) Compilation error

    Answers:
    d) Compilation error

    Explanation:
    % mod moderator canot be used with floating point numbers.

3. Find the output of the following code. (% indicated modulo operation)
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int a = 10, b = 3, c = 2, d = 4, result;
            result = a+a*-b/c%d+c*d;
            printf("%d", result);
            return 0;
        }
    a) -42
    b) 24
    c) 15
    d) -34

    Answers:
    c) 15

4. What is the output of the following C code?

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int h = 8;
            int b = 4 * 6 + 3 * 4 < h * 5?4:3;
            printf("%d\n", b);
            return 0;
        }
    a) 0
    b) 3
    c) 4
    d) Compilation error

    Answers:
    c) 4

    Explanation:
    breaking down the expression
        4 * 6 + 3 * 4 < h * 5?4:3
            precedence of the operators here is 
             1. *
             2. +
             3. <
             4. Tunary operator ?:
        first 4*6 , 3*4 , h*5 will be solved
        second 12+3        
        third- the condition at the end will be 
            36 < 40 ? 4 : 3
            here the expression has reduced to a tunary operation
            since 36 < 40 is true 4 will be the result.

5. What will be the output?

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
            if(c > b > a)
            {
                printf("TRUE");
            }else
            {
                printf("FALSE");
            }
            return 0;
        }
    a) TRUE
    b) FALSE
    c) Syntax Error
    d) Compilation Error

    Answers:
    b) FALSE

    Explanation:
    ordre of precedence here is same so the first expression to be evaluated is from left to right
    c>b is true which is represented as 1
    1>a is false

6. Find the output of the following C code

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int x = 1;
                if((3>5) || (2!=3))
                {
                    printf("IITKGP\n");
                }else if(x &= 0)
                {
                    printf("IITD\n");
                }else
                {
                    printf("IITM\n");
                }
            return 0;
        }
    a) IITKGP
    b) IITD and IITM
    c) IITKGP and IITM
    d) IITM

    Answers:
    a) IITKGP

7. What will be the output?

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int x = 2;
            if(x = 1)
                printf("TRUE");
            else
                printf("FALSE");

            return 0;
        }
    a) TRUE
    b) FALSE
    c) Compilation Error
    d) Compiler Dependent     

    Answers:
    a) TRUE

    Explanation:
    The variable x is initialize as 1
    in the if statement the variable x is reassigned 1
        since = is an assignment operator
    sinve any number except 0 is taken as true the condition evaluated to TRUE  

8. Which of the following statement is correct?
    a) Operator precedence determines which operator is performed first in an expression with more than one operator with different precedence.
        Associativity is used when two operators of same precedence appear in an expression
    b) Operator associativity determines which operator is performed first in an expression with more than one operator with different associativity.
        Precedence is used when two operators of same precedence appear in an expression
    c) Operator precedence and associativity are same.
    d) None of the above

    Answers:
    a) Operator precedence determines which operator is performed first in an expression with more than one operator with different precedence.
        Associativity is used when two operators of same precedence appear in an expression

9. Which of the following method are accepted for assignment?
    a) 8=x=y=z
    b) x=8=y=z
    c) x=y=z=8
    d) None

    Answers:
    c) x=y=z=8

10. What will be the output?
        
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        {
            int x;
            x = 9<5+3 && 7;
            prinf("%d", x);
            return 0;
        }
    a. 0
    b. 1
    c. 7
    d. Compilation error   

    Answers:
    a. 0

    Explanation:
    In the order of precedence 5 + 3 will be evaluated first
    then 9 < 8 return 0
    at last 0 && 7 will return 0
